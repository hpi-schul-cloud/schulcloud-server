# Important Note

When working with the XML files in the assets folder in the `common-cartridge` module, please ensure that they are saved with LF (Line Feed) line endings instead of CRLF (Carriage Return + Line Feed). Additionally, make sure that no new line is inserted at the end of the XML files.

This is important, as the XML files are used for comparison in tests and the Common Cartridge standard does not add a line at the end of the XML files.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.
