# Description
<!--
  This is a template to add as many information as possible to the pull request, to help reviewer and as a checklist for you. Points to remember are set in the comments, please read and keep them in mind:
  
    - Code should be self-explanatory and share your knowledge with others
    - Document code that is not self-explanatory
    - Think about bugs and keep security in mind
    - Write tests (Unit and Integration), also for error cases
    - Main logic should hidden behind the api, never trust the client
    - Visible changes should be discussed with the UX-Team from the begining of development; they also have to accept them at the end
    - Keep the changelog up-to-date
    - Leave the code cleaner than you found it. Remove unnecessary lines. Listen to the linter.
