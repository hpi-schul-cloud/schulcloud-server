# Description
<!--
  This is a template to add as much information as possible to the pull request, to help reviewer and as a checklist for you. Points to remember are set in the comments, please read and keep them in mind:

    - Code should be self-explanatory and share your knowledge with others
    - Document code that is not self-explanatory
    - Think about bugs and keep security in mind
    - Write tests (Unit and Integration), also for error cases
    - Main logic should be hidden behind the api, never trust the client
    - Visible changes should be discussed with the UX-Team from the beginning of development; they also have to accept them at the end
    - Leave the code cleaner than you found it. Remove unnecessary lines. Listen to the linter.

## Approval for review

- [ ] DEV: If api was changed - `generate-client:server` was executed in vue frontend and changes were tested and put in a PR with the same branch name.
- [ ] QA: In addition to review, the code has been manually tested (if manual testing is possible)
- [ ] All points were discussed with the ticket creator, support-team or product owner. The code upholds all quality guidelines from the PR-template.
