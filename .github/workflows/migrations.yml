name: Reminder to update seed data after migration
# If this workflow fails, it is a hint that you forgot to update the seed data after a migration.
# It is only a hint, because it only checks if you updated the migration collection in the seed data.
# It is not a check that you updated the whole seed data correctly.
# See the documentation for advice: https://documentation.dbildungscloud.dev/docs/schulcloud-server/Migrations#committing-a-migration
